# Changelog

All notable changes to gp-dimm-city are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The release workflow refuses to
cut a version that has no `## [X.Y.Z]` heading below.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - unreleased

First release as a standalone package. Extracted from the private
`dimm-city/dc-op-manual` repository, where it lived at `dc-design-guide/` as a
folder extension that the Dimm City books referenced by relative path. The
design guide *book* stays in that repository and now consumes this package
exactly like any other book.

### Added

- **Installable from npm.** `gutterpress ext add gp-dimm-city` vendors the
  package under a book's `plugins/npm/` and pins the exact version — no Node
  packages in the book repo. `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, which the
  old folder package lacked: Gutterpress's npm loader parses a `.js` entry as
  CommonJS without it and refuses the plugin.
- **The brick-wall tile ships.** `dc-native.css` paints the page background
  from `images/brick-bg-01.png`; the old package's `files` list never included
  it, so a published copy would have failed every build with a missing asset.
  `test/package.test.js` now follows every `url()` in every stylesheet into
  the tarball.
- **Font licences.** Titillium Web and Tomorrow ship with the OFL 1.1 text
  from their upstream repositories beside the files; Lixdu ships with its own
  licence file. Fonts are grouped per family under `fonts/` with readable
  names instead of export UUIDs (byte-identical; fonts inline at build time,
  so the rename cannot change a page).
- **Snippets** for the desktop app's snippet picker: every macro an author
  reaches for (`@skill`, `@learning-path`, `@specialty`, `@callout`, `@card`,
  `@gear`, `@block`, `@outcome`, alerts, …) and the three front-matter pages
  every Dimm City book writes (contents, credits, chapter start).
- **Tests** (`bun test`): a fixture snapshot of every macro's output, the
  behavioural tests carried over from the book repo, and package checks —
  every declared path and every stylesheet asset in the tarball, one licence
  per font directory, the cascade contract below, and no runtime imports.
- **CI and release workflows**: tests on every push and PR; a manual release
  workflow that bumps, tags, publishes to npm with provenance via OIDC
  trusted publishing, and cuts the GitHub release.

### Changed

- **`css/` is `styles/`**, matching Gutterpress's extension template. Same
  sixteen sheets in the same cascade order; `tokensFile` now points at
  `styles/dc-palette.css` (the brand palette) rather than the specialty
  identity tokens.
- **The layer statement is `@layer dc.tokens, dc.base, dc.components,
  dc.templates, dc.pages, book;`** — `dc.guide` is gone. A book's own sheets
  belong in `@layer book`, the last layer, which outranks every `dc.*` layer;
  a book that must beat the unlayered `dc-native.css` lists an unlayered sheet
  after the extension. (`dc.guide` existed for the design guide's own
  scaffolding; that book now uses `book` like everyone else.)
- **Front-matter chrome moved in from the books.** The contents-page rows,
  credits role labels and prose, and chapter-start heading rules that lived
  in the design guide's sheet (`dg-overrides.css`, layer `dc.guide`) and the
  credits-page flex layout from the field guide's native sheet are now in
  `page-templates.css` and `dc-native.css`: every Dimm City book writes these
  pages. Values are carried as rendered. Two rules that only ever lost to
  them by layer order were reconciled so nothing changes on the page: the
  dead magenta TOC-divider rule (`page-templates.css`) is removed, and the
  credits role-label colour now says `--ink`, which is what it always
  rendered.
- **Specialty break control moved in from the field guide**: `.dc-specialty
  .dc-learning-path { break-before: always }` and the `.dc-allow-split`
  escape, in `page-templates.css`.
- Plugin `metadata` no longer carries its own `version` (17.3.0 in the book
  repo); `package.json` is the only version. Its `name` is now "Dimm City".
- Stale comments across the stylesheets and plugin that named files from the
  book repo (`dc-components.css`, `native-furniture.css`, `dc-tokens.css`,
  `engineStyles`, `fg-overrides.css`, `dg-overrides.css`, `index.css`) now
  name the package's own files or "the book's own sheet".

### Removed

- `index.css` (an `@import` entry point that reached into the field guide's
  folder) and `dg-overrides.css` (design-guide-only scaffolding, now that
  book's own sheet) are not part of the package.
- The catalog entries `palette-swatch` and `table`, and the `ignore:` block —
  all design-guide-only.
- The `dimm-city-components` package name.
